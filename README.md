# The Movie List
The movie list was the final project of the Vit√≥ria Code Bootcamp, sponsored by PicPay, and aimed to integrate the knowledge acquired during the course.

The project aimed to implement a movie list using the TMDB API. The requirements were:

- The application must be faithful to the UI;
- The project must be modularized, following the Clean and MVVM architecture standards;
- The application must store favorite movies locally;
- Use Crashlytics to map any usage failures;
- Implement automated tests for the created features

Of these points, I could implement only three: implementation according to the UI, modularized design following MVVM architecture, and local storage of movies. Tests are in progress.

## Screens

- Home

  The app's home screen consists of two categories: all movies listed and the user's favorite movies.

- Filter
 
   When you tap a category, movies are filtered. It is crucial to mention that the user can also apply the filter in search mode.

 - Movie details
 
   When clicking on a movie, the user navigates to a screen containing favorite information, the movie's synopsis, evaluation, and its cast.

  - Search mode
  
    When you start typing in the search field, a new screen shows the search results. The user can go back to the previous state by clearing the text field or using the link below the title.

  - Errors
  
    The mapped scenarios are generic errors for request failures and movies not found in a search.

## Android technologies

  On this project I tried to implement:
  
    - RX Kotlin on the search mode;
    - Koin to manage dependency injection;
    - Room to store favorite movies locally;
    - Navigation component to navigate between screens;
    
    
## Improvements

  - Room is working, but the state of the favorite button is not working as it is supposed to. Sometimes it is enabled, and sometimes it is not.
  - Crashlytics is not implemented;
